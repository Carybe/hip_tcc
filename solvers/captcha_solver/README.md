This is an open source code for solving the text-based captchas based on the machine learning technologies. This approach is able to achieve a higher success rate but requires significantly fewer real captchas. Here we exposed partial source code that can run independently for security reasons. Note that it is not production ready. If you encounter any problems, please file an issue on GitHub.
