This repository is where I will place the sources used by my undergrad thesis.

## Copyright Disclaimer
Since I intend on using code from multiple Open Source Software projects, to give the deserved credit to the authors of the respective projects, I place an `.external_repo` file with the URL to such project repository in the root folder where such code is placed.
